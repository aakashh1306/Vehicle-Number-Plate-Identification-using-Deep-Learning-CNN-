# Vehicle-Number-Plate-Identification-using-Deep-Learning-CNN-
This repository contains the codebase for a deep learning project aimed at identifying and recognizing vehicle number plates from images. Leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), this project demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline for license plate detection, character segmentation, and recognition.
